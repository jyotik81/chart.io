# Plotly charts - 

Project Overview :

This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard to visualize the bacterial species living in the navel of candidates of a research about meant protein synthesis from human bacteria. 

Project Challenge : Improbable Beef wants to manufacture synthetic beef. In order to do so, they will need to locate the bacterial species that have the ability to synthize proteins that taste like beef. They will need to locate the bacterial species. 
Lab reports have shown that the bacteria can be found on the human body, specifically in the human belly button. However, not all belly buttons contain the right amount of bacteria. 

To help discover which test subjects have right amount of this bacteria, I have created an interactive dashboard. This customized dashboard allows a user a filter by individual test subject to see their demographic information and what bacterial cultures live in their navels. 

What is created : 

-Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

Project Resources :

Software : 

. Visual Studio 
. Bootstrap 4.4
. Python 
. HTML/CSS
.JavaScript
. Plotly

Project Summary :

The interactive dashboard has a dropdown menu to filter test subjects. There are three charts to visualize test subjects demographic information and what bacterial cultures live in their navel. Hovering over the charts will also reveal more detailed information.
